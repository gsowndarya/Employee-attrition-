Employee Attrition Prediction.
This project aims to analyze employee data and predict attrition using machine learning techniques. Employee attrition refers to the loss of talent within an organization. By predicting attrition, businesses can take proactive steps to retain valuable employees.

Data Preprocessing.
Handled missing values.
Converted categorical variables using (Binary encoding, Label Encoding, One-Hot Encoding).
Handled class imbalance using SMOTE.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA),
Analyzed attrition rates across departments, job roles, satisfaction scores, and more.

Machine Learning Models.
Trained and compared the following models:
Logistic Regression,
Decision Tree,
Random Forest Classifier,
XGBoost,
Support Vector Machine (SVM).

Evaluation Metrics.
Accuracy,
Precision, Recall, F1-Score,
ROC-AUC Curve,
Confusion Matrix.
